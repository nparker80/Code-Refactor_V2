Project Description:

A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. I am cleaning up the code and adding comments to the .css file so other developers can easily identify the style elements utilized and their intended effect on the Horieson webpage.



The acceptance criteria for this project is summarized below:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
