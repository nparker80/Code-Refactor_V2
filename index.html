			<p class="about-me-details"></p>
				Welcome! My name is Najla Parker and I am currently working as a program planner in the Program Management Organization within Raytheon Technologies. I have spent the last 7 years working in the defense contractor world supporting various types of programs and honing my project management skills. After working with software development teams and participating in the timing of releases, increment planning and observing the backlog grooming sessions; I decided it was my turn! This is what led me to join the 24 week Coding Bootcamp at The University of Denver. 
			</p>

				I am eager to explore the opportunities associated with my new career as a developer. I look forward to a lifetime of learning and evolving as well as the opportunity to problem solve. These are my favorite aspects of being a developer thus far and something I employ daily in my current role. As I continue the journey to become a full stack developer, I am keeping an open mind and trying to discover what I most enjoy. Will it be front end, back end, a particular programming language? Time will tell!
